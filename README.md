# WIP MERN Template

This app is intended to serve as a starting point for quickly prototyping ideas.

It comes with a MongoDB database, NodeJS backend using Express, and two react frontends built on Material-UI (with redux for state management).

You can use one or both of the React frontends, one is intended as an admin UI (based off GCP), the other is intended as a typical user portal (based off AirBnB).

I have taken care to use the latest versions of each package that has been used in this project, and the latest features available in those packages.  In particular, the frontend apps exclusively use React functional components with hooks, and redux took kit utilities.
